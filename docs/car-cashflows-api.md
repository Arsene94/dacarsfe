# Car Cashflows API

Track every incoming or outgoing amount for each vehicle, with a clear split between cash, card or mixed payments. All endpoints
require an authenticated admin and the relevant `car_cashflows.*` permission.

| Method | Description | Auth | Permission |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET `/api/car-cashflows` | Paginated ledger entries. Filter by `car_id`, `direction`, `payment_method`, `created_by`, `occurred_on_date`, `occurred_on_month`, `created_date`, `created_month`. Supports `?include=car,createdBy`. | Admin | `car_cashflows.view` |
| GET `/api/car-cashflows/{id}` | Retrieve a single ledger entry with optional relationships. | Admin | `car_cashflows.view` |
| POST `/api/car-cashflows` | Create a new income or expense entry (fields below). | Admin | `car_cashflows.create` |
| PUT/PATCH `/api/car-cashflows/{id}` | Update an entry. Amount validations re-run when payment method changes. | Admin | `car_cashflows.update` |
| DELETE `/api/car-cashflows/{id}` | Remove an entry from the ledger. | Admin | `car_cashflows.delete` |

## Fields
- `car_id` (required) – vehicle identifier (`dacars_cars.id`).
- `direction` (required) – `income` or `expense`.
- `category` – optional label (max 80 chars) to group entries (e.g. `chirii`, `service`, `taxe`).
- `description` – free text explaining the transaction.
- `payment_method` (required) – one of `cash`, `card`, `cash_card`.
- `total_amount` (required) – numeric ≥ 0. For `cash`/`card` methods it is auto-aligned with the corresponding amount.
- `cash_amount` – numeric ≥ 0. Required (and >0) whenever `payment_method` is `cash_card`.
- `card_amount` – numeric ≥ 0. Required (and >0) whenever `payment_method` is `cash_card`.
- `occurred_on` (required) – Date and time (`Y-m-d H:i:s`) when the amount was recorded.
- `created_by` – optional admin/staff identifier. Defaults to the authenticated user when omitted.
- Responses include `created_by`. Use `?include=createdBy` to embed the staff profile that registered the entry.

### Filtering helpers

- `payment_method` – `cash`, `card` or `cash_card`.
- `direction` – `income` or `expense`.
- `created_by` – numeric user id that registered the entry.
- `occurred_on_date` – filter by the calendar day the transaction happened (`Y-m-d`).
- `occurred_on_month` – filter by the month the transaction happened (`Y-m`).
- `created_date` – filter by the day the record was created in the system (`Y-m-d`).
- `created_month` – filter by the month the record was created in the system (`Y-m`).

## Validation rules
- For `payment_method = cash`, the whole `total_amount` is stored as cash. Any provided `card_amount` is ignored.
- For `payment_method = card`, the `total_amount` is stored as card. Any provided `cash_amount` is ignored.
- For `payment_method = cash_card`, both `cash_amount` and `card_amount` must be positive and their sum must equal `total_amount`.
- Updating the payment method from single to mixed requires sending both split amounts again.
