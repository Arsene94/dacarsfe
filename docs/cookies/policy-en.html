<h1>COOKIE POLICY</h1>
<p><strong>regarding the use of cookies on <a href="https://www.dacars.ro">www.dacars.ro</a></strong></p>
<p>The website <strong>www.dacars.ro</strong> is operated by <strong>DELTA FLOT S.R.L.</strong>, with its registered office at Strada Demnității nr. 27, Sector 1, Bucharest, registered with the Trade Register under no. J40/5093/2023, VAT number 47820724, legally represented by Mr. Vescu Pavel Ion, as administrator (the &ldquo;<strong>Company</strong>&rdquo;). The Company acts as data controller and is committed to protecting your personal data in accordance with applicable privacy laws, including Regulation (EU) 679/2016 (the &ldquo;<strong>Regulation</strong>&rdquo;) and other relevant national provisions.</p>
<p>The website (hereinafter the &ldquo;<strong>Website</strong>&rdquo;) uses cookies and similar technologies (collectively the &ldquo;<strong>Cookies</strong>&rdquo;). The information below explains how Cookies are placed, used and managed on the Website.</p>
<p>We use Cookies to ensure the proper functioning of the Website, to optimise content, to analyse traffic and to improve the browsing experience. Advertising and marketing activities based on Cookies or cookie-derived data are carried out only when an appropriate legal basis exists.</p>
<p>Cookies provide useful insights into how visitors navigate the Website, allowing us to increase efficiency and accessibility. <strong>This policy may be updated periodically</strong> to reflect regulatory changes or adjustments in our processing. Updated versions will be published on the Website.</p>
<h2>1. What are cookies?</h2>
<p>An &ldquo;internet cookie&rdquo; (also known as a &ldquo;browser cookie&rdquo; or &ldquo;HTTP cookie&rdquo;) is a small text file stored on the computer, mobile phone or other device from which the Internet is accessed. A cookie consists of two parts: name and value. Technically, only the web server that sent the cookie can access it again when the user returns to the associated site.</p>
<p>Cookies do not in themselves require personal data and, in most cases, the information collected does not identify users. However, they may capture information such as IP address, geolocation, operating system, device resolution, visited pages, duration of visits and the way the Website is used. Based on these details we can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>adapt the Website&rsquo;s presentation (language, resolution and layout);</li>
    <li>display personalised advertising according to your interests;</li>
    <li>create anonymous statistics that help us improve structure and content;</li>
    <li>maintain web security.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on their lifespan, cookies may be:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Session cookies</strong> &ndash; deleted automatically when the browser is closed;</li>
    <li><strong>Persistent cookies</strong> &ndash; stored on the device until they expire or are manually removed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Third-party cookies</h2>
<p>Certain sections or features of the Website may be provided by third parties (e.g. analytics or advertising services). These third parties can place their own cookies (&ldquo;third-party cookies&rdquo;). They are required to comply with applicable laws and with our privacy commitments. The list of Cookies used, including the providers, is set out below.</p>
<h2>3. Cookies used</h2>
<p>The Website uses the following categories of Cookies:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Strictly necessary Cookies</strong> &ndash; ensure the Website runs correctly;</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics Cookies</strong> &ndash; help us understand how visitors interact with the Website;</li>
    <li><strong>Marketing Cookies</strong> &ndash; measure campaign performance and allow relevant advertising.</li>
</ul>
<p>Consent for analytics and marketing Cookies can be withdrawn at any time by adjusting your browser settings, by using the opt-out tools provided by the third-party vendors listed below, or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:gdpr@dacars.ro">gdpr@dacars.ro</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to Cookies, Mixpanel and the language selector store persistent values in <strong>localStorage</strong>: <code>dacars.locale</code> (preferred language) and <code>mp_{token}_mixpanel</code>, <code>mp_{token}_mixpanel__c</code> (anonymous Mixpanel identifiers). These values are not shared with third parties and can be deleted from your browser settings.</p>
<h2>4. How are Cookies used on the Website?</h2>
<p>During a visit, the necessary Cookies are installed automatically. Analytics and marketing Cookies are activated only if your browser permits it. The Meta Pixel implementation checks the <em>Global Privacy Control</em> signal and the <em>Do Not Track</em> setting; if they are enabled, marketing events are not sent.</p>
<p>Analytics and marketing Cookies allow us to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>analyse the Website&rsquo;s performance and tailor content to your preferences;</li>
    <li>measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns and prevent repetitive ads;</li>
    <li>understand user journeys within booking forms to fix bottlenecks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Third parties may set their own anonymous cookies to measure specific campaigns or personalise the experience. The Website cannot access those cookies, just as third parties cannot access the Cookies we set.</p>
<h2>5. Transfer of information collected through Cookies</h2>
<p>The Company relies on third-party service providers to operate the Website, acting as data processors. Employees responsible for data management and the external partners involved may access the information collected through Cookies.</p>
<p>We do not share cookie-derived data with other parties without consent, unless required by law. Google, Meta, TikTok and Mixpanel may transfer data to the United States; standard contractual clauses and additional safeguards imposed by those providers apply.</p>
